        <br />
        -> You, or people associated with You may have directly or indirectly
        influenced the outcome of an event; <br />
        -> You, or people associated with You may have access to insider

        8.11 We may close Your Account, cancel and/or refund any of Your
        winnings found in the “Available to Bet” balance, (after the deduction

        any refunds on balances remaining on the Account. ‘Abuse’ is defined
        as, but not limited to, software-aided play on multiple games
        concurrently to generate more rounds of a game that could not be done
        naturally by a human player playing alone. Also, the practice of
        ‘cherry-picking’ games with ‘value’ jackpots, to the rank exclusion of
        all other games, will be considered an abuse of the spirit in which
        the jackpot is intended. In all cases where abuse has been proven
        beyond a reasonable doubt, We retain the right to confiscate all of
        the winnings and any balance remaining on the Account. <br />
        8.14 All transactions will be monitored and/or reviewed to prevent
        money laundering.

        9.1 Making Deposits Payment methods can be found under both “My
        Account” and “Deposit” pages of the Site. The payment methods made
        available to You may change. Some payment methods may not be available
        in all countries. When choosing a payment method, You agree to the
        terms of that payment method, You agree to any charges that apply, You
        agree that the payment method is valid and You agree that the payment
        account or card belongs to You and that You have the right to use the
        payment method. The billing descriptor for all Bank Card payments will
        show up as it's own website. It is unlawful to deposit money which has
        been obtained illegally. We accept payments made in EUR, BRL, USD or
        such other currency as is made available in the currency drop down
        from time to time. You must choose one currency as the currency of
        Your Account. Any payments received in a currency other than the one
        chosen by you will be converted into the currency of Your Account at
        the exchange rate We choose. Also, any exchange premiums are payable
        by you. When payment is made using a credit card, We may request a
        certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure
        that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are
        visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also
        not visible. We do not accept cash directly or cash delivered to any
        payment solution provider. <br />
        9.2 Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is determined,
        or when We confirm the result of an event, any winnings will be made
        available to you on Your Account. If We mistakenly credit Your Account
        with winnings that do not belong to You for any reason, these will be
        taken back from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings
        before We become aware of this error, You must immediately inform Us
        and will be required to pay this back. If You do not We will take all
        legal action available to us to recover this debt. <br />
        9.3 Withdrawals You may withdraw any amount up to the “Available to
        Bet” balance in Your Account by issuing a valid notice of withdrawal.
        Notices for withdrawals must be made on the Site only. If You want to
        withdraw all Your funds, You must first cancel any outstanding stakes.
        You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the
        Games found on the Site. If You request a withdrawal without turning
        over an amount that is equal or more than the amount deposited, We
        reserve the right to enforce a turnover of the full or part of the
        previous deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal
        requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We suspect that funds
        are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons.
        Prior to accepting a withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal
        identification, for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or
        other such documentation as We feel is required in the circumstances.
        We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other
        such verification as is required to ensure that You are who You say
        You are. If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively exceed EUR 2,000
        (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will carry out
        additional verification procedures. We may also carry out these
        verification procedures even in the case of lower withdrawals. Where a
        withdrawal is to be made using a credit card, We may request a
        certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure
        that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are
        visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also
        not visible. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment
        method chosen by You when placing a deposit, unless We decide
        otherwise or are unable to do so. If You deposit using a number of
        payment methods, We reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across
        such payment methods and process each part through the respective
        payment method at Our discretion and in accordance with anti-money
        laundering policies and regulations. The time for a withdrawal request
        to be finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a withdrawal
        attempt should be approved or denied within three (3) business days.
        When a withdrawal is cancelled, the funds are returned back to your
        account and you can make use of those funds accordingly on the
        account. webiste does not assume any responsibility for any funds lost
        during gameplay following a withdrawal cancellation either by you or
        by us. All winnings of 20,000 EUR or more (excluding progressive
        jackpot wins), we reserve the right to divide the payout into ten
        installments, paid with 10 per cent of the winning sum every month
        until the full amount is paid out. It is at the players discretion to
        request a withdrawal every month until the funds are entirely paid
        out. We may request that You redirect Your withdrawal or cancel it or
        request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in
        accordance with anti-money laundering polices and/or regulations.
        Cancellation of a withdrawal (whether this was made by You or Us) does
        not entitle You to any compensation should You choose to play with the
        funds in Your Account before any withdrawal is completed. We reserve
        the right to charge an administrative fee in the event that You
        proceed with more than 30 approved withdrawals/payout requests during
        one (1) calendar month. The administrative fee shall be 2% of the
        transaction value but no less than EUR 5. It shall be charged on each
        withdrawal following the 30th withdrawal within each given month.{" "}
        <br />
        9.4 Chargebacks If a chargeback on a card or depositing method You
        have used is requested by the payment method provider, We may take the
        following steps: <br />
        -> We may block Your Account; <br />
        -> We may take any such action as we are entitled to by law; <br />
        -> A chargeback notice may be issued and sent to You, using Your

        be subject to an administrative fee of fifty (50) euros each, which

        number, computer/device and/or IP address. <br />
        12.2 Any “welcome” Bonuses are only available to new customers who
        open an Account on the Site and who have never held an Account on the
        Site before, have never received a welcome offer of any kind and who
        are invited to take part in a welcome offer by virtue of it being
        specifically offered to them when they register on the Site <br />
        12.3 Some Bonuses must be manually activated by You in Your Account.
        Unless stated otherwise, You can do this after logging into Your
        Account and depositing the amount required to access the Bonus. Such
        Bonuses can only be activated when real money is available in Your
        Account. If You play with any of Your deposited funds prior to
        claiming the Bonus, lost funds cannot be used to activate the Bonus.{" "}
        <br />
        12.4 When You claim a Bonus, Your real money, the Bonus and all
        winnings generated from them will remain as Bonus money and may not be
        withdrawn or wagered on other products until wagering requirements are
        met. <br />
        12.5 All Bonuses have a wagering requirement that needs to be
        completed within a given time frame before any potential winnings
        and/or bonuses can be withdrawn. Failure to meet the required wagering
        requirements and/or forfeit of an active Bonus for any reason may
        result in the forfeit of all winnings attained from Your real money as
        well as Your Bonus and bonus winnings attained throughout the wagering
        process of the Bonus. Any attempt to withdraw any funds or cash out
        any placed bets prior to the complete fulfilment of the Bonus wagering
        requirement, may result in the Bonus and any winnings attained
        (including winnings that originated from Your real money used to get
        the Bonus) being forfeited. System bets do not count towards the
        wagering requirements. Only bets that have been placed and settled
        during the campaign period will be considered towards the wagering
        requirements. Any bets that are placed and settled outside this period
        will not count. <br />
        12.6 Any evidence or reasonable suspicion that specific bets were
        placed on any Game (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes
        in the same hand to create "action") without risk will not qualify for
        any wagering requirement. Examples of bets without risk include
        betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting
        player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. If You are found to be
        colluding with other players, for example, one person betting on the
        player, the other betting on the banker, You will have Your bets
        cancelled, Account closed and all deposits made by You may be
        forfeited. <br />
        12.7 If You cancel the Bonus You will lose the Bonus and all winnings
        generated from the Bonus. <br />
        12.8 We have the right to refuse any player a Bonus or We may alter
        the Bonus (including cancellation), if We believe that: <br />
        -> The Bonus is being abused (Our definition of abuse includes but is
        not limited to a player making use of promotional offers without ever
        risking their own funds); <br />
        -> Technical issues have occurred in relation to the Bonus; <br />
        -> The Bonus is, for any reason, not able to be conducted as planned.{" "}
        <br />
        12.9 We offer promotions in good faith to players who use Our services
        for entertainment purposes. We reserve the right to cancel or remove a
        player’s access to these games in the case of suspected abuse of this
        offer and also, should we deem it necessary, to terminate the
        offender’s Account with immediate effect. In the case of an offender’s
        Account being closed, We will not be liable to refund any losses made
        by a player on any Games or to refund any balances on the player’s
        Account. ‘Abuse’ includes but is not limited to using software and/or
        opening multiple accounts in order to gain an unfair advantage on a
        Bonus. In all cases of abuse, We retain the right to withhold all
        winnings and any balances remaining on Your Account. <br />
        12.10 All Bonuses are intended for recreational players and/or as
        tokens of appreciation to Our customers and We therefore reserve the
        right to restrict eligibility to participate in all or part of any
        Bonus. <br />
        12.11 The maximum withdrawal amount allowed from winnings earned from
        any Bonus or free spins offer before a deposit has been made is €100
        or the equivalent in Your Account currency <br />
        12.12 Unless stated otherwise on the specific bonus landing pages, all
        Bonuses in the Casino have got a max bet restriction in place of €5
        per game round or €.50c bet per line (or currency equivalent) and
        failure to adhere to this max bet rule may result in Account closure
        and forfeit of the Bonus and any winnings attained during the wagering
        of the Bonus. For currency equivalent, the following conversion rates
        shall apply unless specifically stated otherwise in the Bonus Terms
        and Conditions: <br />
        -> BRL: R$1 = €4 <br />
        -> USD: €1 = $1 <br />
        12.13 Irregular Play At any time, We may decide to review all records
        and play transactions and/or to monitor Your use of any Bonus or
        Bonuses. If Irregular play is suspected, We reserve the right to
        disqualify You from any free spins promotion or Bonus or other form of
        promotion and/or withhold all deposits and/or winnings and/or close
        Your Account. Irregular play is considered bonus abuse and is not
        permitted on the Site. Irregular play can include (but is not limited
        to): low margin betting, equal betting, zero risk bets or hedge
        betting. These are considered Irregular Play when done purposely to
        exploit Bonuses, in addition the following types of play are
        considered irregular play: <br />
        -> Increasing the balance and then changing Your gaming pattern
        significantly (bet, game type, bet structure or other pattern of
        betting) to complete any wagering requirements of any Bonus; <br />
        -> Using any betting system or placing even money bets on any game of
        chance; and / or <br />
        -> Using the “Double-Up” or gamble feature within a game to increase
        win values; <br />
        -> Increasing Your balance after placing high value bets and
        thereafter proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior bet
        value, in order to meet bonus wagering requirements; <br />
        -> Wagering on Games that do not contribute towards wagering
        requirements or Games with a 0% wagering weight applied to them as
        specified in the specific bonus landing page terms; <br />
        -> Wagering on games with bonus money to build up value, lose the
        bonus and then cash out on the built-up value with a secondary
        deposit; <br />
        -> Short term, repetitive and/or unnecessary deposits and withdrawals
        in order to generate more bonuses. <br />
        12.14 Unless provided otherwise in the bonus scheme, all bonuses for
        stakes, winnings, etc. only apply for starting price and fixed odds
        bets and not for multiples, ante-post bets or Tote betting. Should
        multiples be part of a bonus scheme, the respective bonus shall relate
        to the final winnings amount and not to every leg's winning. <br />
        12.15 Only one Bonus shall be granted per operation (e.g., bet,
        deposit). Should a Customer qualify for several Bonuses, only the
        Bonus with the highest Bonus amount shall be granted.
      </p>
      <h4>13. Responsible Gaming</h4>
      <p>
        13.1 Gambling can be addictive. If You need some help to overcome such
        addiction, kindly follow this link which will redirect You to Our
        Responsible Gaming page on the Site. Please always gamble responsibly.{" "}
        <br />
        13.2 Limits You may impose limits on Your Account. These limits are:{" "}
        <br />
        13.2.1 Deposit Limit You may choose to limit Your maximum losses. This
        limit will automatically block any further deposits made if the
        deposit limit set has been exceeded for that selected time frame.{" "}
        <br />
        13.2.2 Session Time Limit You may choose to limit the time You spend
        enjoying Our Games. This pop up will appear, reminding You of the time
        limit You imposed on yourself and will allow you to log You out of
        Your Account or continue enjoying Our games. Kindly contact support to
        be able to set this limit. Where a session time limit falls on the
        hour, this pop up will be replaced by the Reality Check if you are
        resident outside of the United Kingdom. If You change Your mind, these
        limits can be changed by letting Us know via e-mail. Increasing or
        revoking a limit shall have effect only after seven (7) days; whereas
        decreasing a limit shall have effect immediately. <br />
        13.3 Reality Check If You are resident outside of the United Kingdom
        and only when playing on casino Games on the Site, a pop up will
        appear which will pause Your Game to remind You that you have been
        playing for one hour. This will be done every hour. This pop up will
        remind You of how much You lost and how much You won. You will then
        select to continue to enjoy Our Games or log out. This pop up might
        appear later than the automatic one hour schedule if Your Game does
        not allow for temporary suspension. This pop up will appear
        immediately after Your Game ends once You have come back to Our lobby.
        We will not always be able to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality
        Check on the time promised. For example, if You play auto spin games,
        live games or games which are not hosted on Our Site We will be unable
        to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check reminders until the
        game has finished or You return to Our lobby. You can deactivate the
        Reality Check at any time by opting-out on the pop up. If You would
        like to reactivate this, kindly contact support or refer to the ‘My
        Account’ tab. <br />
        13.4 Self-Exclusion and Cool Off <br />
        13.4.1 You may choose to completely exclude yourself from playing any
        of the Games on Our Site. To do so You must login and go to the
        Self-Exclusion page. For residents outside of the United Kingdom, You
        stipulate the period You wish to be self-excluded for and Your Account
        will automatically be reactivated. If You are resident in the United
        Kingdom, self-exclusion will apply for a minimum of 6 months and You
        must then contact customer support to have Your Account reactivated.{" "}
        <br />
        13.4.2 You will not be able to open any Account with the Site should
        You opt for selfexclusion. You will also forfeit any entry into any
        competition or draw which was entered into prior to such self
        –exclusion as well as forfeiting any noncash prizes or invitations
        which have been granted to You or offered to You prior to such
        self-exclusion but which have not yet been redeemed or utilised by You
        (for example, where tickets for an event have been offered but the
        event is to take place during a self-exclusion period, the invitation
        is automatically withdrawn upon self-exclusion) . This is to prevent
        gambling being promoted to You in a time where You have taken some
        time to assess Your gambling behaviour. <br />
        13.4.3 You may also choose to “cool off” if you are a UK resident. You
        may want to take a break from gambling and a ‘cooling off period’ can
        be set for a period of: 24 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks or 6 weeks. Please
        contact support or visit this link when logged in to request a cool
        off period. At the end of any cool off period, Your Account will
        automatically be reactivated. <br />
        13.5 Other If We believe that gambling will cause You financial or
        personal difficulties, We may close Your Account. You must not open a
        new Account. If You do so, it will be at Your own risk and We cannot
        be held liable.

        time the Game got miscarried, the monetary value of the credit will be
        paid out to Your Account or, if Your Account no longer exists, it will
        be to You directly, in an approved manner; <br />
        14.5 We shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that Our computer
        system enables Your participation in a Game. If after You have made a
        wager game play is interrupted by a failure of the telecommunications
        system or a failure of Your computer system, the Game will resume as
        at the exact time immediately before the interruption occurred. If
        however, such resumption is not possible We shall: <br />

      <h4>26. Insolvency</h4>
      <p>
        We hold all customer funds in a separate bank account. You must be
        aware that these funds are not protected in the case of insolvency and
        therefore in the event that We should go insolvent, Your funds may not
        be returned to You. For customers in the United Kingdom, We have a
        duty to inform You that this level of protection is classed as the
        basic level. For more information, please see here.

      <h4>27. Applicable Law, Jurisdiction and Language</h4>
      <p>
        27.1 These Rules are published in a number of languages. It is only
        the English version that forms the legal basis of the relationship
        between us, but all versions reflect the same principles. Translations
        into other languages are made as a service and in good faith, in the
        event of any discrepancy between an English version and a translation,
        the English version shall prevail.
      </p>
      <h4>28. Appendix</h4>
      <p>
        28.1 Game Specific Rules The Rules included in this section relate to
        specific Games. We sometimes use Games provided by other companies and
        they ask us to include these rules in our own Rules. There are
        sometimes Rules which are so specific to a Game, you only need to be
        aware of those Rules if you play that Game. All of these rules have
        been dropped in this section. By playing any of the Games you will be
        agreeing to these Game Rules.
